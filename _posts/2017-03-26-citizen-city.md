> This small book was born out of my love for the profession of architecture.

> I believe there is a malaise within both the education of the profession and the media's articulation of the role of the architect. We have become the instrument of business and market forces whose ethical compasses can often be uninspired and self-serving. The projects described in this book, which are blessed with rare enlightened clients, are a drop in the ocean, but are a little attempt to take a meaningful role in enabling "the good" within our communities.

> To many pure design oriented architects within our profession, we are seen as "selling out" when we participate in the engine of commerce. I would argue that our role is too essential and too important to relinquish to others. So this is an architecture of resistance, cloaked in convention.

> While our communication today seems boundless and global, we still eat, sleep, and procreate as we have for millennia. For true meaning to exist in any artistic endeavour, it must be grounded in both the daily life of humanity and the world of the work. Look around you and ask yourself what you would like to change for the better. Seek out mentors, friends, and colleagues who share your passions.

> All revolutions start as grassroots movements.

### Citizen City

> The vision of a Citizen City is one that transcends the traditional urban goals of economic stability and working infrastructure, and allows for inclusivity of its people, with a variety of economic levels, different cultures, and diverse identities. A Citizen City also provides and encourages open access to democratic and civic engagement, and develops cultural facilities and promotes cultural identity, thus enhancing a sense of community. Diversity, inclusivity, and civic engagement represent the true "richness" of an urban center and can provide the basis for cultural sustainability: this is a Citizen City.

I won't reproduce it here, but there is a great summary of what characterizes Canada and Canadian Values, on page five of the introduction.
