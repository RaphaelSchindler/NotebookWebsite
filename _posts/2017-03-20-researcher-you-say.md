# A _researcher_, you say?

I just changed my LinkedIn headline to say, "Human-computer interaction (HCI) researcher interested in designing technologies to be used by humans," and I feel I must defend my claim of styling myself a _researcher_, and I might as well explain what I mean by the second part of the headline.

You may accuse me that being unaffiliated with any educational institution, how could I call myself a researcher? And don't I mislead with such a title? But I believe that I am taking actions in good faith that accord very much with what a researcher of HCI (human-computer interaction) would do, and furthermore, though I am unaffiliated with any particular academic groups or denominations, I do affiliate myself closely with a far more illustrious and respectable 'educational institution' than even the Harvards and Stanfords, and I speak of the institution of human self-determination, which always includes learning at its root.

I will add that I have a degree in Mathematics from one of the most illustrious schools for that subject in the world, the University of Waterloo; but the period in my life of the highest 'academic' activity did not take place during the pursuit of that degree, but actually many years afterwards: and my engagement in an educational sense is only increasing. So I can say with conviction that I am a far better student or researcher *now*, than when I was in school and had a stronger claim to such a title ('stronger' in the eyes of society, that is).

Secondly, to explain the second part of the headline, it contains an absurdity: for *whom* could I be designing these 'technologies,' if not for humans? I mean to suggest that whatever the industry has been doing that it's been calling 'design,' that effort has not really included an understanding of how human beings actually work. And *that* understanding is hard to come by. So of course we haven't been designing technologies for humans.

I am reminded of when I was young and the field of _ergonomics_ was burgeoning. I thought it preposterous that, 'Now we're going to be design chairs that actual humans can sit on,' for example. Or more recently, a kind of medicine has been emerging under the name _functional medicine_, which engenders the strikingly obvious intention, 'Now we're going to perform medicine in a way that people don't get sick,' begging the question, _what the hell has medicine been doing thus far, if not preventing illness?_

This is an amazing time we live in. And I use that word very deliberately. I could say _mesmerizing_, except that I'm provoked to action (rather than paralysis). In our society, so many *really simple things* just *don't work*, and it's blindingly, *painfully* obvious.
