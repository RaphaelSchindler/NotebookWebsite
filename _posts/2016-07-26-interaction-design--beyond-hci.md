# From reading _Interaction design: beyond human-computer interaction, 3rd edition_

Interaction design is a broader-scoped discipline than human-computer-interaction (HCI): "designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives," or in my own words: interaction design is the discipline of creating human-computer interactions that support and reflect the way people communicate and interact.

> One main aim of interaction design is to reduce the negative aspects (e.g. frustration, annoyance) of the user experience while enhancing the positive ones (e.g. enjoyment, engagement). In essence, it is about developing interactive products1 that are easy, effective, and pleasurable to use — from the user's perspective.

Human-computer interaction (HCI) is:

The process of interaction design is 1. Establishing requirements, 2. Designing alternatives, 3. Prototyping, and 4. Evaluating.

Term of art: _usability engineering_.

Usability is broken down into the goals: effectiveness, efficiency, safety, utility, learnability, memorability.

Desirable aspects of user experience: satisfying, enjoyable, engaging, pleasurable, exciting, entertaining, helpful, motivating, challenging, enhancing sociability, supporting creativity, cognitively stimulating, fun, provocative, surprising, rewarding, emotionally fulfilling; and undesirable ones: boring, frustrating, making one feel guilty, annoying, childish, unpleasant, patronizing, making one feel stupid, cutesy, gimmicky.

> Online shopping experiences are increasingly about persuading people to buy rather than being designed to make shopping easy. This involves designing for persuasion, emotion, and trust – which may or may not be compatible with usability goals.

* * *

Some design principles are: visibility, feedback, constraints, consistency.

Term of art: a _conceptual model_ is "a high-level description of how a system is organized and operates."
