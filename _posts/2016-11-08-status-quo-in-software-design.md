# On the disgraceful _status quo_ in software design

I'm pained by the status quo in software design, which I find to be reprehensible. To witness shabby products succeed in the marketplace inflames my sense of righteous indignation. The other day a bank teller was becoming upset with how difficult her computer system was making a straightforward task. Isn't technology supposed to empower us? Aren't we supposed to feel amazing from the consciousness of leverage, the feeling that we can accomplish more with less? Sadly, this isn't how most of us view technology anymore. For many, software has become so lousy it provokes us to anxiety.

I'm on a mission to change that: I want software to be about people being empowered. So what am I going to do?

One:
I am going to help software-makers design better software.

Two:
I am going to help people distinguish good software design from bad.
