# Who I am and why I'm sharing my notebook

<aside in-the-margin><figure><img class="small" src="/assets/self.jpg"></figure></aside>
I am a single man in his late thirties living near the ocean in beautiful Ambleside on the Canadian west coast. My entire life having been unproductive of any noticeable benefit as far as others are concerned, this has now become the proper and important object of my activity and life: I have bound myself to making a difference: my life is dedicated to the service of humanity.

You, dear reader, being a stakeholder in this initiative; and so myself being accountable to you; I am happily obliged to keeping you informed about the ongoing progress of what I'm taking on, and this is the first reason for publishing my notes.

Secondly, I love to think, which when it's going well tends to produce and involve many notes and illustrations; and if I could harbour a hope that these artifacts may yet be useful to readers, or inspiring, I am permitted to take the time to perfect and refine my notes accordingly as my pleasure dictates.

I hope you will enjoy them, or even grow to love them.

With sincerity,<br>
Raphael
