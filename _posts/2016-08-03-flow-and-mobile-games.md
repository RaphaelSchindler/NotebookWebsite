# From reading _The Effect of Flow Experience and Social Norms on the Adoption of Mobile Games in China_, by Shang Gao _et al_.

> TAM [technology acceptance model] is widely acknowledged as one of the most robust and influential models for explaining user acceptance of technology. It is an adaptation of Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). According to TRA, belief (an individual's subjective probability of the consequence of a particular behavior) influence as attitude (an individual's positive and negative feelings about a particular behavior), which in turn shapes behavioural intention.

> TAM [technology acceptance model] posits that users' IT acceptance is a function of two cognitive beliefs: perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, and they are two primary determinants of information system acceptance.

> Perceived ease of use was defined as "the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free from effort."

> Perceived usefulness refers to "the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her job performance."

> The original concept of flow was first introduced by Csikszentmihalyi and LeFevre (1989). Flow has been defined as the holistic experience that people feel when they act with total involvement.

> [Flow] is a state of experience in which one is completely absorbed and engaged in an activity in a manner where nothing else seems to matter.

> When indulged in flow, people enjoy a series of fluent activities such as artistic performance, game playing, and rituals with a distorted sense of time, loss of self-awareness, and a feeling of transcendence and complete immersion.

> Social norms consist of two distinct parts: informational influence and normative influence. Informational influence occurs when a user accepts information obtained from other users as evidence about reality, while normative influence refers that when a person conforms to the expectations of others to obtain a reward or avoid a punishment.

> In this paper, we defined social norms as the extent to which the user perceives the others' approval of his/her behavior on playing a mobile game.

Aside: Could I design software that predisposes a flow experience, or at least doesn't harm one?
