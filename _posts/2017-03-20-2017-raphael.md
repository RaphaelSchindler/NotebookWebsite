# What does _2017-Raphael_ look like?

These are things I desire to be able to declare about the version of myself that I will observe at the end of this year: in other words, these are the *habits* I am committing to cultivating in myself:
<p delete-line/>
- I make regular, measurable contributions to humanity in general.
- I make regular, measurable contributions to my local community.
- I think and write all the time.
- I move all the time---it may be skiing, dance, or even just trail running.
- I touch all the time---if I should have a girlfriend we can imagine how this desire would be fulfilled; but what I really mean is that we human beings derive a kind of nourishment from touch; and I am interested that this be as 'simple' as possible, by which I mean _platonic_. Think: partner dances; martial arts.
- I'm involved in 3D technology in some way.
- I suffer no obligations.
- I've arranged it so that I am sustaining myself, in the financial sense, as a byproduct of taking the day-to-day actions outlined above.
