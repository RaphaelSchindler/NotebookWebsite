# On sensitivity

Hermann Hesse says:
<p delete-line/>
> Great masses of people these days live out their lives in a dull and loveless stupor. *Sensitive persons find our inartistic manner of existence oppressive and painful*, and they withdraw from sight… I believe what we lack is joy. The ardor that a heightened awareness imparts to life, the conception of life as a happy thing, as a festival… But the high value put upon every minute of time, the idea of hurry-hurry as the most important objective of living, is unquestionably the most dangerous enemy of joy.

The emphasis is mine; I *myself* am such a sensitive person. But what does it mean to exist 'inartistically?' Supposing art to be a way of being in touch (with the human experience, for example), an artless or inartistic way of existing, then, is characterized by being out of touch.

I have always been too sensitive, until I learned that they were wrong who compelled me to believe that. Now I embrace my sensitivity. It keeps me growing. We're accustomed to picking our apples well before they're ripe, but we don't confine this practice to agriculture. Those aren't really *apples* we see in our grocery stores, and scientists tell us that they're barely a fifth as good as apples properly picked. And they're not really *people* our society produces.

I base my conviction on an observation having to do with touch. When I was a child, I touched and tasted everything, and that interface was so rich it provoked a mind to develop at an astonishing rate. This is how to grow a human being.

I wonder if mathematicians prefer to be touched more, on account of their occupation with abstractions, to compensate for their work which leaves the senses idle. I am not a mathematician, but I wanted to be one, and certainly I spend much of my time revolving imaginary objects in my mind, and I do feel an unusual compulsion, as if a hunger, towards movement and touch of all kinds.

That last phrase may provoke some to a sexual train of thought. But first I must add that I am compelled to *ski*, and to *dance*; and if I happen to have a girlfriend at the time, what we would do I believe is different from what I think others do. Where others have *sex*, we call it *touching*. I can confidently say that people don't know how to have sex properly, because they don't see it for what it is. They think it to be an activity, or to have a reason, or to have a meaning, or to be part of an investment in a relationship, and they miss the point: firstly, that it is not about the outcome, but the act; secondly, that it is all about touch.

Love is a kind of learning. When you love someone, you commit to learning everything you can about him. And the fastest way to learn is the same as the fastest way to grow a human being. It requires a richly sensitive area of contact. It happens with touch.

Maybe the problem is that *men* have created our modern culture, but for hundreds of years, mothers have been teaching men not to be sensitive. What can we expect to happen?

But the fact that rejecting sensitivity turns society from a decent path isn't the worst thing, and the most dire consequence of dulling our senses is we begin to die prematurely, or what else do you call it when you're not *really* alive? I want to be as alive as I can.
