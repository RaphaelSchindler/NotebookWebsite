- _Understanding Computers and Cognition_, by Terry Winograd and Fernando Flores
- Published in 1986

* * *

They consider topics that "appear to be worlds apart," in order to "let the apparent chasms become spaces in which new possibilities are revealed."

* * *

They treat certain questions in an interesting way; so they address the challenge, e.g. 'Can computers understand language?,' not in order to solve it, but rather to *dissolve* it.

> We look towards new questions that can lead to the design and use of machines that are suited to human purposes.

Aside: I wonder: What are the various ways that technology can be satisfying?

* * *

> All new technologies develop within the backgrounds of a tacit understanding of human nature and human work. The use of technology in turn leads to fundamental changes in what we do, and ultimately in what it is to be human. We encounter the deep questions of design when we recognize that in designing tools we are designing ways of being. By confronting these questions directly, we can develop a new background for understanding computer technology---one that can lead to important advances in the design and use of computer systems.

'The nature of the background that serves as a basis for human thought and action.'

'To arise in a background of understanding.'

What is "the implicit understanding of design that guides technological development within our existing tradition of thought?"

* * *

> Practice shapes our language and language in turn generates the space of possibilities for action.

* * *

They view a tradition as:
<p delete-line></p>

- "A pre-understanding that opens the space of possible answers."
- A "pervasive, fundamental phenomenon that might be called a 'way of being.'"
- "A way of understanding, a background, within which we interpret and act."
- "That which invisibly gives shape to our thought."

* * *

> We always exist within a pre-understanding determined by the history of our interactions with others who share the tradition.

* * *

Our tradition is concealed:
<p delete-line/>
> In trying to understand a tradition, the first thing we must become aware of is how it is concealed by its obviousness.
<p delete-line/>
And:
<p delete-line/>
> It takes a careful self-awareness to turn the same gaze on our own lives and 'unconceal' our own tradition---to bring into conscious observation that which invisibly gives shape to our thought.

* * *

The _rationalistic tradition_:
<p delete-line/>
> A powerful tradition that emphasizes 'information,' 'representation,' and 'decision making.'
<p delete-line/>
And a beautiful irony:
<p delete-line/>
> The rationalistic tradition is distinguished by its narrow focus on certain aspects of rationality, which [...] often leads to attitudes and activities that are *not rational* when viewed in a broader perspective.
<p delete-line/>
(Emphasis mine)

Aside: I'm out to *question and challenge the assumptions the software industry accepts implicitly*.

* * *

On how new technologies can transform our society:
<p delete-line/>
> As the use of a new technology changes human practices, our ways of speaking about that technology change our language and our understanding. This new way of speaking in turn creates changes in the world we construct.
<p delete-line/>
And:
<p delete-line/>
> In order to become aware of the effects that computers have on society we must reveal the implicit understanding of human language, thought, and work that serves as a background for developments in computer technology.

* * *

What a computer does:
<p delete-line/>
> The computer is a device for creating, manipulating, and transmitting symbolic (hence linguistic) objects.

* * *

> Our commitment is to developing [_sic_] a new ground for rationality---one that is as rigorous as the rationalistic tradition in its aspirations but that does not share the presuppositions behind it.
<p delete-line/>
And:
<p delete-line/>
> The task we have undertaken in this book is to challenge the rationalistic tradition, introducing an alternative orientation that can lead to asking new questions.

They "attempt to create a new understanding of how to design computer tools suited to human use and human purposes."

* * *

Aside: (Using their phrasing) I am interested in "those areas of human experience where individual interpretation and intuitive understanding (as opposed to logical deduction and conscious reflection) play a central role."

* * *

Fernando Flores "is primarily interested in the understanding of social reality that we can gain through combining theory and practice."

* * *

Restating their intention, they define design as "the interaction between understanding and creation," and they state their goal to be to "address the broader question of how a society engenders inventions whose existence in turn alters that society."

* * *

Mr. Winograd and Mr. Flores find themselves to be in accord with writers having interests such as biology, hermeneutics, and phenomenology.

* * *

> Heidegger stands out as the modern philosopher who has done the most thorough, penetrating, and radical analysis of everyday experience.
<p delete-line/>
And
<p delete-line/>
> Gadamer has been most articulate in applying this orientation to the problem of language, a problem that we see as central.

* * *

The work is discussed of "Humberto R. Maturana, a Chilean neurobiologist most widely known for his work on the neurophysiology of vision," which work they find to be "critical in the development of our understanding of cognition and of our perspective on the rationalistic tradition."

* * *

_Speech act theory_ suggests that "language, and therefore thought, is ultimately based on social interaction."

> Speech act theory is a starting point for an understanding of language as an act of social creation.

Using speech act theory as a foundation, they synthesize their own theory, which, "leads us to the conclusion that we create our world through language, an observation that has important consequences for design."

* * *

### An outline of the book: parts I, II, and III

> Part I of the book (Chapters 1--6) describes the rationalistic tradition and presents three distinct bodies of work, each of which stands in contrast to that tradition and each of which has deeply influenced our own understanding.

> The rejection of cognition as the manipulation of knowledge of an objective world, the primacy of action and its central role in language, and the impossibility of completely articulating background assumptions all play a major role in the critique of current computer technology presented in Part II and in the new design orientation elaborated in Part III.

> Part II (Chapters 7--10) addresses concrete questions about what computers do.

> Part III (Chapters 11 and 12) presents an alternative orientation to design, based on the theoretical background we have developed.

Their approach being question-based, they stress that the relevant questions are "those opening up a potential for computers that play a meaningful role in human life and work."

Summarizing their outline in my own words, the parts of the book involve:
<p delete-line></p>

- I. Ontology---or, How does a human being work?;
- II. What do computers do?; and
- III. What *can* computers do (in order to "play a meaningful role in human life and work").

* * *

What managers do:
<p delete-line/>
> Much of the work that managers do is concerned with initiating, monitoring, and above all coordinating the networks of speech acts that constitute social action.

* * *

> In one sense then, this is a book about computers. But it reaches beyond the specific issues of what computers can do. Our larger goal is to clarify the background of understanding in which the discourse about computers and technology takes place, and to grasp its broader implications. Ultimately we are seeking a better understanding of what it means to be human. In this quest, progress is not made by finding the 'right answers,' but by asking meaningful questions---ones that evoke an openness to new ways of being. We invite the readers to create with us an openness that can alter our collective vision of how computer technology will develop in the coming decades.

* * *

The rationalistic tradition:
<p delete-line/>
- "Has been the mainspring of Western science and technology."
- "Finds its highest expression in mathematics and logic."
- "Has greatly influenced the development of linguistics and psychology."

Mr. Winograd and Mr. Flores find the rationalistic tradition to be problematic, and labour to convey that viewpoint. I see a more fundamental problem. I see that tool use itself is problematic, and through using tools, we change ourselves: in learning to use a knife, you begin to keep an eye out for things to cut. So what happens in a society steeped in tools as we are? By this influence that tool use has on our psychology, we must be really distorting the truth of our existence.

To wit:
<p delete-line/>
> Much of our book is an attempt to show the non-obviousness of the rationalistic orientation and to reveal the blindness that it generates.

* * *

> [Herbert] Simon characterizes the basic assumption of decision-making theory as follows:
<p delete-line/>
> > At each moment the behaving subject, or the organization composed of numbers of such indificuals, is confronted with a large number of alternative behaviors, some of which are present in consciousness and some of which are not. Decision, or choice, as the term is used here, is the process by which one of these alternatives for each moment's behavior is selected to be carried out. The series of such decisions which determines behavior over some stretch of time may be called a _strategy_. ... If any one of the possible strategies is chosen and followed out, certain consequences will result. The task of rational decision is to select that one of the strategies which is followed by the preferred set of consequences.
<p delete-line/>
> (Simon, _Administrative Behavior_ (1976), p. 67)

I make decisions using a simpler approach: I relinquish that whatever be the fruits of my actions, not myself but *humanity* be the beneficiary; and this protects me from the danger of prefering actions whose outcomes benefit myself only. Then, entitled only to the actions but not to their outcomes, I consider which action would please me most to be performing, and this pleasure-seeking is my primary guide. I must caution that most of my readers will misunderstand me on this point, unless I add that one of my most important tasks in cultivating myself is to learn to feel pleasure and pain at the right things, so, for instance, if I feel pleasure from someone's misfortune, it indicates that I have more work to do in *educating* myself (and this, by the way, is how Aristotle defines _education_; 'learning to feel pleasure and pain from the right things.')

The authors summarize Herbert Simon's view on the rational decision-making process:
<p delete-line/>
> Simon asserts that *rational* decision making is a process of choosing among alternatives, and that it involves a series of steps:
<p delete-line/>
> - Listing all the alternative strategies.
> - Determining all the consequences that follow upon each of these strategies.
> - Comparatively evaluating these sets of consequences.

> This caveat is the major contribution of Simon.
<p delete-line/>
> > ... The word 'all' is used advisedly. It is obviously impossible for the individual to know 'all' his alternatives or 'all' their consequences, and this impossibility is a very important departure of actual behavior from the model of objective rationality.
<p delete-line/>
> (Simon, _Administrative Behavior_ (1976), p. 67)
<p delete-line/>
Well done, everybody; now we're at the heart of the matter: *different people will see different actions available to them*. This touches on the problem of why some of us are rich while others are poor. Much of that comes accidentally, but beyond accident, successful people and non-successful people take vastly different actions day-to-day. We are accustomed to believe that success is predicated on hard work, but I suspect poor people to be complicit in maintaining and cultivating their poverty by the actions they daily take: I think it may even be more difficult to be *un*successful.

* * *

On the emergence of cognitive science:
<p delete-line/>
> In declaring that it exists as a science, people are marking the emergence of what Lakatos calls a 'research programme.' Lakatos chooses this term in preference to Kuhn's 'paradigm' (_The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_, 1962) to emphasize the active role that a research programme plays in guiding the activity of scientists. He sees the history of science not as a cyclic pattern of revolution and normal science, but as a history of competing research programmes. He distinguishes between 'mature science,' consisting of research programmes, and 'immature science,' consisting of "a mere patched up pattern of trial and error."
<p delete-line/>
And I am provoked to re-declare my own undertaking using this attractive terminology: *I am pursuing a programme of research to understand and improve how humans and computers interact*.
<p delete-line/>
> A research programme is more than a set of specific plans for carrying out scientific activities. The observable details of the programme reflect a deeper coherence which is not routinely examined.
<p delete-line/>
And they go on to explain that this not-routinely-examined "deeper coherence" is problematic if it shapes intellection but is itself not properly understood; this is obvious to me; and I still like the sound of 'programme' to describe what *I* am up to.

To look into: _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_, by Thomas Kuhn.

* * *

Mr. Winograd and Mr. Flores point out an assumption that if false could topple all of Science: the assumption that phenomena observed 'in isolation' will yield general laws. Mr. Buckminster Fuller will point very simply to the concept of _synergy_, which law operates exactly opposite to how we're conducting our high-horsed scientific inquiry. Hmm. This seems very clear to me now. Are we looking at one of those huge paradoxes of our age, similar to the one where we expect doctors to keep us healthy who are paid when we get sick?

I am reminded of something Thoreau observes: "Shams and delusions are esteemed for soundest truths, while reality is fabulous." (Thoreau, _Walden_)

* * *

> Gadamer devotes extensive discussion to the relation of the individual to tradition, clarifying how tradition and interpretation interact. Any individual, in understanding his or her world, is continually involved in activities of interpretation. That interpretation is based on prejudice (or _pre-understanding_), which includes assumptions implicit in the language that the person uses.
<p delete-line/>
Interesting connotation: _prejudice_ &#x27F7; _pre-understanding_.

* * *

> Heidegger and Gadamer reject the commonsense philosophy of our culture in a deep and fundamental way. The prevalent understanding is based on the metaphysical revolution of Galileo and Descartes, which grew out of a tradition going back to Plato and Aristotle. This understanding, which goes hand in hand with what we have called the 'rationalistic orientation,' includes a kind of mind-body dualism that accepts the existence of two separate domains of phenomena, the _objective_ world of physical reality, and the _subective_ mental world of an individual's thoughts and feelings. Simply put, it rests on several taken-for-granted assumptions:
<p delete-line/>
> - We are inhabitants of a 'real world' made up of objects bearing properties. Our actions take place in that world.
> - There are 'objective facts' about that world that do not depend on the interpretation (or even the presence) of any person.
> - Perception is a process by which facts about the world are (sometimes inaccurately) registered in our thoughts and feelings.
> - Thoughts and intentions about action can somehow cause physical (hence real-world) motion of our bodies.

* * *

Interesting:
<p delete-line/>
> Kant called it "a scandal of philosophy and of human reason in general" that over the thousands of years of Western culture, no philosopher had been able to provide a sound argument refuting psychological idealism---to answer the question "How can I know whether anything outside of my subjective consciousness exists?"<br><br>Heidegger argues that "the 'scandal of philosophy' is not that this proof has yet to be given, but that *such proofs are expected and attempted again and again*."

* * *

> By drawing a distinction that I (the subject) am perceiving something else (the object), I have stepped back from the primacy of experience and understanding that operates without reflection.

* * *

Aside: I feel presently, as it were, to be exploring the very perimeter of human understanding. (In all seriousness, that's what this book is about.) As Mr. Winograd and Mr. Flores consider how interpret<em>er</em> and interpret<em>ed</em> bleed into one another, my imagination is moving to suspect that all things correlate, and the question is arising, How can I be sure that the *future* does not influence the *present*?

* * *

They quote Gadamer (and I find this language to be beautiful):
<p delete-line/>
> It is not so much our judgments as it is our prejudices that constitute our being. ... the historicity of our existence entails that prejudices, in the literal sense of the word, constitute the initial directedness of our whole ability to experience. Prejudices are biases of our openness to the world. They are simply conditions whereby we experience something---whereby what we encounter says something to us.
<p delete-line/>
(Gadamer, _Philosophical Hermeneutics_ (1976), p. 9)

It deserves repeating: "_Prejudices are biases of our openness to the world_."

* * *

They relate four significant points from Heidegger's work, and all are natural to me except the fourth, which piques me, and is interesting to chew on:
<p delete-line/>
- "Our implicit beliefs and assumptions cannot all be made explicit."---obviously.
- "Practical understanding is more fundamental than detached theoretical understanding."---this is intuitive.
- "We do not relate to things primarily through having representations of them."---whoever would've thought that?!
- "Meaning is fundamentally social and cannot be reduced to the meaning-giving activity of the individual subjects."---here we go.

* * *

Interesting background on Heidegger's philosophy:
<p delete-line/>
> Many people encountering the work of Heidegger for the first time find it difficult to comprehend. Abstract terms like 'Dasein' and 'thrownness,' for instance, are hard to relate to reality. This is the opposite of what Heidegger intends. His philosophy is based on a deep awareness of everyday life. He argues that the issues he discusses are difficult not because they are abstruse, but because they are concealed by their 'ordinary everydayness.'

* * *

> In sum, Heidegger insists that it is meaningless to talk about the existence of objects and their properties in the absence of concernful activity, with its potential for breaking down. What really *is* is not defined by an objective omniscient observer, nor is it defined by an individual---the writer or computer designer---but rather by a space of potential for human concern and action. In the second part of the book we will show how shifting from a rationalistic to a Heideggerian perspective can radically alter our conception of computers and our approach to computer design.

* * *

This Maturana seems a capital fellow:
> Beginning with a study of the neurophysiology of vision, which led to the classic work on the functional organization of the frog's retina, he [Maturana] went on to develop a theory of the organization of living systems and of language and cognition.

* * *

Conveying Maturana's discoveries in neurophysiology, they tell us:
<p delete-line/>
> There is no difference between perception and hallucination.

* * *

Aside: I wonder if all current endeavours at creating artificial intelligence are misguided: I wonder if their implementors are trying to represent knowledge in terms of objects and attributes, thinking that that's how our human nervous system works. (Mr. Winograd and Mr. Flores relate to us Maturana's work, which indicates a different sort of functioning.)

* * *

A fascinating way of viewing an organism:
<p delete-line/>
> The structure of the organism at any moment determines a _domain of perturbations_---a space of possible effects the medium [_ie_ the environment, _etc_] could have on ghe sequence of structural states that it could follow.

* * *

Two cool new words; _phylogeny_, _ontogeny_:
<p delete-line/>
> Maturana seeks to explain the origins of all phenomena of cognition in terms of the phylogeny (species history) and ontogeny (individual history) of living systems.

* * *

### Autopoiesis
> Maturana and Varela characterize the organization of the living as 'autopoietic.' An autopoietic system is defined as:
<p delete-line/>
> > ... a network of processes of production (transformation and destruction) of components that produces the components that: (i) through their interactions and transformations continuously regenerate the network of processes (relations) that produced them; and (ii) constitute it (the machine) as a concrete unity in the space in which they (the components) exist by specifying the topological domain of its realization as such a network.
<p delete-line/>
> (Maturana and Varela, _Autopoiesis and Cognition_ (1980), p. 79)

> If the autopoiesis is interrupted, the system's organization---its identity as a particular kind of unity---is lost, and the system disintegrates (dies). An autopoietic system that exists in physical space is a living system.

The authors assure us:
<p delete-line/>
> At first sight, this definition may seem irrelevant or trivial. But it is in fact a carefully crafted statement expanding on a simple idea: the essential characteristic of a living system is that it is a collection of components constituting a unity that can live or die.
