# Notes from reading _Understanding Computers and Cognition_

## From the introduction

<span pale>[In my experience the _introduction_ often forms the most significant part of a written work. It's where the author is tasked to give the best face to his ideas that he can, as well as challenged to bridge the chasm between the reader's (hypothetical) context of mind and the context of the work. So you may expect this first section to be the most fruitful.]</span>

They preface with explaining that disparate topics will be considered that "appear to be worlds apart," but their intention is to "let the apparent chasms become spaces in which new possibilities are revealed."

<span pale>[Aside: What are the various ways that technology can be satisfying?]</span>

"All new technologies develop within the backgrounds of a tacit understanding of human nature and human work. The use of technology in turn leads to fundamental changes in what we do, and ultimately in what it is to be human. We encounter the deep questions of design when we recognize that in designing tools we are designing ways of being. By confronting these questions directly, we can develop a new background for understanding computer technology---one that can lead to important advances in the design and use of computer systems."

Fernando Flores "is primarily interested in the understanding of social reality that we can gain through combining theory and practice."

They found themselves to be in accord with writers having interests such as biology, hermeneutics, and phenomenology.

<span pale>[Aside: I'm out to *question and challenge the assumptions the software industry accepts implicitly*.]</span>

They treat certain questions in an interesting way; so they address the challenge, e.g. 'Can computers understand language?,' not in order to solve it, but rather to *dissolve* it.

<span pale>[Phrasing: 'they arise in a background of understanding.']</span>

"We look towards new questions that can lead to the design and use of machines that are suited to human purposes."

Restating their intention, they define design as "the interaction between understanding and creation," and they "address the broader question of how a society engenders inventions whose existence in turn alters that society."

A valuable question is, What is "the implicit understanding of design that guides technological development within our existing tradition of thought?"

The first part of the book discusses the nature of the background that serves as a basis for human thought and action.

On how new technologies can transform our society: "As the use of a new technology changes human practices, our ways of speaking about that technology change our language and our understanding. This new way of speaking in turn creates changes in the world we construct." And: "In order to become aware of the effects that computers have on society we must reveal the implicit understanding of human language, thought, and work that serves as a background for developments in computer technology."

They define a computer: "The computer is a device for creating, manipulating, and transmitting symbolic (hence linguistic) objects."

<span pale>[Phrasing: "How practice shapes our language and language in turn generates the space of possibilities for action."]</span>

### The rationalistic tradition

They view a tradition as:
<p delete-line></p>

- "A pre-understanding that opens the space of possible answers."
- A "pervasive, fundamental phenomenon that might be called a 'way of being.'"
- "A way of understanding, a background, within which we interpret and act."
- "That which invisibly gives shape to our thought."

"We always exist within a pre-understanding determined by the history of our interactions with others who share the tradition."

Our tradition is concealed: "In trying to understand a tradition, the first thing we must become aware of is how it is concealed by its obviousness." And: "It takes a careful self-awareness to turn the same gaze on our own lives and 'unconceal' our own tradition---to bring into conscious observation that which invisibly gives shape to our thought."

The _rationalistic tradition_: "A powerful tradition that emphasizes 'information,' 'representation,' and 'decision making.'" And a beautiful irony: "The rationalistic tradition is distinguished by its narrow focus on certain aspects of rationality, which [...] often leads to attitudes and activities that are *not rational* when viewed in a broader perspective." (Emphasis mine)

Their commitment: "Our commitment is to developing [sic] a new ground for rationality---one that is as rigorous as the rationalistic tradition in its aspirations but that does not share the presuppositions behind it." And: "The task we have undertaken in this book is to challenge the rationalistic tradition, introducing an alternative orientation that can lead to asking new questions."

They "attempt to create a new understanding of how to design computer tools suited to human use and human purposes."

<span pale>[(Using their phrasing) I am interested in "those areas of human experience where individual interpretation and intuitive understanding (as opposed to logical deduction and conscious reflection) play a central role."]</span>

### Preceding work

"Heidegger stands out as the modern philosopher who has done the most thorough, penetrating, and radical analysis of everyday experience." And "Gadamer has been most articulate in applying this orientation to the problem of language, a problem that we see as central."

They preface that they will present the work of "Humberto R. Maturana, a Chilean neurobiologist most widely known for his work on the neurophysiology of vision," which work was, they say, "critical in the development of our understanding of cognition and of our perspective on the rationalistic tradition."

  "language, and therefore thought, is ultimately based on social interaction"
</p></aside>
And they will consider _speech act theory_, which suggests that "language, and therefore thought, is ultimately based on social interaction." Further: "Speech act theory is a starting point for an understanding of language as an act of social creation."

<aside in-the-margin pale><p without-vertical-margins>
  "we create our world through language"
</p></aside>
Considering this preceeding work, they will synthesize their own theory, which they say, "leads us to the conclusion that we create our world through language, an observation that has important consequences for design."

### The parts of the book: I, II, and III

"Part I of the book (Chapters 1--6) describes the rationalistic tradition and presents three distinct bodies of work, each of which stands in contrast to that tradition and each of which has deeply influenced our own understanding."

"The rejection of cognition as the manipulation of knowledge of an objective world, the primacy of action and its central role in language, and the impossibility of completely articulating background assumptions all play a major role in the critique of current computer technology presented in Part II and in the new design orientation elaborated in Part III."

"Part II (Chapters 7--10) addresses concrete questions about what computers do."

<aside in-the-margin pale><p without-vertical-margins>
  How can computers "play a meaningful role in human life and work?"
</p></aside>
"Part III (Chapters 11 and 12) presents an alternative orientation to design, based on the theoretical background we have developed." And their approach being question-based, they stress that the relevant questions are "those opening up a potential for computers that play a meaningful role in human life and work."

Interesting way to view management: "Much of the work that managers do is concerned with initiating, monitoring, and above all coordinating the networks of speech acts that constitute social action."

Summarizing their outline in my own words and special brand of brevity, the parts of the book involve:
<p delete-line></p>

- I. Ontology---or, How does a human being work?;
- II. What do computers do?; and
- III. What *can* computers do (in order to "play a meaningful role in human life and work").

They summarize their intention beautifully in the introduction's final paragraph: "In one sense then, this is a book about computers. But it reaches beyond the specific issues of what computers can do. Our larger goal is to clarify the background of understanding in which the discourse about computers and technology takes place, and to grasp its broader implications. Ultimately we are seeking a better understanding of what it means to be human. In this quest, progress is not made by finding the 'right answers,' but by asking meaningful questions---ones that evoke an openness to new ways of being. We invite the readers to create with us an openness that can alter our collective vision of how computer technology will develop in the coming decades."

[I am excited to read on! But this is a great time for an intermission.]
