# From reading Peter Drucker's _Managing Oneself_

These are, in my opinion, the most important ideas in the book.

* * *

Mr. Drucker recommends, first, finding out one's strengths1, then advises, "put yourself where your strengths can produce results," and "work on improving your strengths."

* * *

He adds, "it is equally essential to remedy your bad habits," highlighting bad manners or "intellectual arrogance" as a bad habit particularly common among knowledge workers:

> Manners are the lubricating oil of an organization. It is a law of nature that two moving bodies in contact with each other create friction. Bright people, especially bright young people, often do not understand this. If ... someone's brilliant work fails again and again as soon as cooperation from others is required, it probably indicates a lack of courtesy—that is, a lack of manners.

* * *

He recommends against doing work in an area "in which we have no talent or skill and little chance of becoming even mediocre:"
<p delete-line/>
> In those areas a person—and especially a knowledge worker—should not take on work, jobs, and assignments. One should waste as little effort as possible on improving areas of low competence.

* * *

He recommends knowing the unique way we work, our 'personality' when it comes to working. He observes that:
<p delete-line/>
> Too many people work in ways that are not their ways, and that almost guarantees nonperformance. ... Just as people achieve results by doing what they are good at, they also achieve results by working in ways that they best perform.

* * *

> Do not try to change yourself—you are unlikely to succeed. But work hard to improve the way you perform. And try not to take on work you cannot perform or will only perform poorly.

* * *

> Successful careers are not planned. They develop when people are prepared for opportunities because they know their strengths, their method of work, and their values. Knowing where one belongs can transform an ordinary person—hardworking and competent but otherwise mediocre—into an outstanding performer.
