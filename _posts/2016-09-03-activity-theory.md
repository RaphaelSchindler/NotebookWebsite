# From reading _Activity Theory in HCI: Fundamentals and Reflections_, by Victor Kaptelinin

Around the late 1980s–early 1990s human-computer interaction (HCI) was reinventing itself as a field dealing with "human actors" rather than "human factors."

> Activity theory, a conceptual approach originating in the Russian psychology of the 1920s and 1930s, maintains that human uses of technology can only be understood in the context of purposeful, mediated, and developing interaction between active "subjects" and the world (that is, "objects").

> [Activity theory] was one of the leading contenders as a theoretical foundation for second-wave HCI [human-computer interaction].

* * *

HCI has three key topical areas: agency, experience, and activity-centric computing.

* * *

> We believe that those of us who understand technology—which we regard as the most powerful shaping force of our era—have a special brief to be aware of and to engage theories that underwrite certain intellectual and ethical commitments. While we realize that not everyone heads this call, the commitments are of significant social importance and include: the possibility for positive change, a complexly developed notion of human agency, and the active promotion of social justice.

Technology is an outcome of design, and design is under the aegis of human intentionality and imagination.
