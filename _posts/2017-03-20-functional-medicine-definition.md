# What I don't like about how the Institute for Functional Medicine defines _functinal medicine_

> Functional Medicine is a personalized, systems-oriented model that empowers patients and practitioners to achieve the highest expression of health by working in collaboration to address the underlying causes of disease.

*Gross*. I'd apologize for my denigration to whomever wrote this if it so clearly didn't have a single author, and it weren't so obvious that this is the kind of thing 'done by committee' that furnishes evidence for idiomatic expressions such as, _too many cooks spoil the broth_.

Anyway, let's take this apart, so that you can be upset along with me:
<p delete-line/>
- "Functional Medicine is a *personalized*, *systems-oriented* model..."---so, what, is traditional (_ie_ western, non-functional) medicine non-personalized and not oriented about 'systems?' What does that mean?
- "...that *empowers* patients and practitioners to achieve..."---is traditional medicine *not* empowering?
- "...to achieve the *highest expression* of health..."---isn't this obvious? Or do they mean to suggest that traditional medicine strives for an expression of health that is not the *highest* expression?
- "...by working in *collaboration* to *address the underlying causes* of disease."---do they mean to suggest that traditional medicine does not involve collaborative work, or does not address the underlying causes of disease?

But why am I upset? Two things. The need of a new term for medicine in the first place: it is upsetting that the word 'medicine' has strayed so far from 'keeping people healthy,' that we now need a new term for it. (There was a similar movement in the domain of management, the so-called _value-based_ management which meant management that actually provided value.)

The second reason I'm upset is because functional medicine is one of the most important movements of our day, because it strives to make people healthy while admitting that 'medicine' as we know it has failed to do so.

This definition *does* say some important things, that it then dilutes (_eg_ by including superfluous or unclear phrasing). Let's see if we can't get at the essentials: --- 'Functional Medicine is an approach to health that addresses the underlying causes of disease.' --- Powerful because it suggests that traditional (_ie_ western) medicine does *not* address the underlying causes of disease. Yes, they think they do, but they're not looking as 'upstream' as they like to think: by the time you're 'sick' by their standard, you're *really far gone.* (I find it interesting to read about Karma, which claims to identify disease at the earliest point possible, so early that its issue can be as simple as a *bad thought* towards someone.)

This superior definition deserves restating: _Functional medicine is an approach to health that addresses the underlying causes of disease_.
