# Some powerful questions for provoking a change of mind

What if I'm probably wrong about everything?

* * *

What if I can't ever improve?

* * *

What if nothing I'm going to do today is actually important?

* * *

What if the most important action for me to take today is something I won't do because I don't see it?

* * *

What if---(I'm afraid to add this)---what if I only did what I was afraid to do?
